<h1>Tutorial for Dueling Bots</h1>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Each player starts with 500 HP (Health), and both players attack using cards until their health goes to zero.</p>
<p><a href="cards.html">You can view all 15 cards here.</a></p>
<h2>Card Types</h2>
<p>There are three types of cards:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attack cards - deal damage to your opponent</li>
    <li>Healing cards - heal yourself</li>
    <li>Defense cards - protect yourself against an upcoming attack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Card Hands</h2>
<p>Each turn, you are given 5 random cards.  <b>There may be duplicates in any hand.  The other four will be discarded when you play one card.</b></p>
<p>This being said, there is no guarantee you will get one of any specific card type.</p>
<h2>Last, but not least, Card IDs</h2>
<p>Cards are numbered 1-15.  You can find this on the bottom right of the card.  Simple, no?</p>

<h1>Some advanced methods:</h1>
<p>When you want to use more advanced methods (like playing specific cards):</p>
<pre>
playCardFromID(cardID)
</pre>
<p>Which plays a specific card.  Before calling this, you should call:</p>
<pre>
hasCardOfID(cardID)
</pre>
<p>To make sure you can actually play the card, otherwise your bot may crash.</p>
